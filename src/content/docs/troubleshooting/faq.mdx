Answers to frequently asked questions, sourced from the [Copybara mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues).

## General

### Is Copybara stateless?

**Yes, by design.** Copybara stores state in the destination repository itself, not in local files.

From [Issue #196](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/196), a Copybara collaborator confirmed:

> "Yes, it is stateless. We designed like that on purpose."

A contributor clarified the mechanism:

> "Copybara is stateless because it relies on the `GitOrigin-RevId` trailer existing in the destination repository in order to determine revision list that needs to be migrated."

This means multiple users or CI jobs can run Copybara for the same config and get consistent results. The `~/copybara` folder is only used for caching, not persistent state.

**See also:** [State Management Guide](/guides/state-management/)

### Can I use a custom state label instead of GitOrigin-RevId?

**Yes.** Use the `custom_rev_id` parameter in `core.workflow`.

From [Custom label for copybara state](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss/c/h8bO8G0Udog):

> There's `experimental_custom_rev_id` setting in `core.workflow` which lets you customize the revision ID.

<Aside type="caution">
  The parameter was renamed from `experimental_custom_rev_id` to
  `custom_rev_id`. The old name is deprecated and scheduled for removal.
</Aside>

```starlark
core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    # Use custom label instead of GitOrigin-RevId
    custom_rev_id = "X-Backport-Id",
    # ...
)
```

### Is bidirectional sync possible?

**Yes, but it requires two separate workflows.** Copybara requires one repository to be the source of truth.

From [Issue #140](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/140):

> A user asked about using Copybara for bidirectional sync between external (public) and internal (private) GitHub repos.

The pattern is:

1. **Push workflow**: Internal → External (source of truth is internal)
2. **Pull workflow**: Import external PRs back to internal

## Configuration

### How do I use environment variables in copy.bara.sky?

**You cannot directly reference environment variables** like `${VAR}` in the config file.

From [Issue #125](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/125), the recommended approaches are:

**1. Use Starlark macros** to create parameterized workflows:

```starlark
def make_workflow(name, destination_url):
    return core.workflow(
        name = name,
        destination = git.destination(url = destination_url),
        # ...
    )

# Define multiple workflows
make_workflow("prod", "https://github.com/org/prod")
make_workflow("staging", "https://github.com/org/staging")
```

**2. Use command-line flags** to override values at runtime:

```bash
copybara migrate copy.bara.sky \
  --git-destination-url "https://x-access-token:${TOKEN}@github.com/org/repo"
```

**3. Generate config from template** before running Copybara:

```bash
envsubst < copy.bara.sky.template > copy.bara.sky
copybara migrate copy.bara.sky
```

### Can I split configuration across multiple files?

**Yes!** Use Starlark's `load()` statement to import from other `.bara.sky` files.

From [Issue #268](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/268), a Copybara collaborator confirmed:

> "Yes, starlark has a `load` statement to include other files. You will want to write a function that returns a list of transforms."

**Example:**

```starlark title="common.bara.sky"
# Define reusable replacements
replacements = {
    "old_name": "new_name",
    "old_import": "new_import",
}

def common_transforms():
    return [
        core.replace(before = k, after = v)
        for k, v in replacements.items()
    ]
```

```starlark title="copy.bara.sky"
load("common", "common_transforms")

core.workflow(
    name = "default",
    transformations = common_transforms() + [
        # workflow-specific transforms
    ],
    # ...
)
```

This pattern is useful for:

- Organizing transforms per directory/module
- Sharing common replacements across workflows
- Keeping the main config file clean

### Why does my config file need to be named copy.bara.sky?

**It's a requirement, not just convention.** The filename must be `copy.bara.sky`, but the path can vary.

From [Issue #127](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/127), a Copybara maintainer clarified:

> "This is expected. Copybara requires that the main config file is called 'copy.bara.sky'. The path can change, but not the name."

**Valid examples:**

```bash
# These work - different paths, same filename
copybara migrate /path/to/copy.bara.sky
COPYBARA_CONFIG=/configs/copy.bara.sky

# This does NOT work - different filename
COPYBARA_CONFIG=my-config.sky  # Error!
```

---

## Docker & CI

### Is there an official Docker image?

**No official image is published by Google.** You can build from source or use community images.

From [Issue #82](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/82):

> It would be super helpful to have a copy of the latest master or release published as a docker image.

The issue remains open. Google has not published an official image.

**Community alternatives:**

- [Olivr/copybara-action](https://github.com/Olivr/copybara-action) - Builds nightly images
- `gcr.io/copybara-docker/copybara` - Community-maintained image
- Build your own from the Dockerfile in the repo

### How do I pass command line arguments with Docker?

**Use environment variables**, as the entrypoint doesn't pass arguments directly.

From [Issue #158](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/158):

> The Docker entrypoint does not pass command line arguments that are given to docker run.

```bash
docker run -e COPYBARA_WORKFLOW=my-workflow \
           -e COPYBARA_SOURCEREF=main \
           -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
           copybara
```

**Environment variables:**

- `COPYBARA_CONFIG` - Config file path (default: `copy.bara.sky`)
- `COPYBARA_WORKFLOW` - Workflow name
- `COPYBARA_SOURCEREF` - Source reference
- `COPYBARA_OPTIONS` - Additional options
- `COPYBARA_SUBCOMMAND` - Subcommand (migrate, validate, etc.)

### Can I run Copybara in GitHub Actions?

**Yes.** Use the community action or Docker directly.

From [Issue #123](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/123):

> Is it possible to run Copybara in GitHub actions?

```yaml
- uses: olivr/copybara-action@v1
  with:
    ssh_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
```

**See also:** [GitHub Actions Guide](/cicd/github-actions/)

---

## Authentication

### How do I use deploy keys with Copybara?

**Challenge:** GitHub doesn't allow the same SSH key as a deploy key in two different repos.

From [Issue #131](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/131):

> Users wanted to give Copybara access to origin with read-only key and destination with read/write key.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use a machine user account** with access to both repos
2. **Use GitHub App** for authentication ([Issue #264](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/264))
3. **Use HTTPS tokens** instead of SSH:
   ```bash
   echo "https://x-access-token:${TOKEN}@github.com" >> ~/.git-credentials
   ```

### How do I sync between two private repos?

Mount your SSH credentials into the Docker container.

From [Copybara for 2 private repos](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss/c/WlmBc6XlvSs):

```bash
docker run -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
           -v ~/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig \
           -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
           copybara migrate copy.bara.sky
```

## Workflows & Testing

### How do I test a Copybara workflow before running it?

**Use `--dry-run` and `folder.destination`.**

From [Recommended process for adding new workflows?](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss/c/3TOr1ExHReU):

> How does one test a copybara workflow? Testing workflows is difficult.

**Approaches:**

1. **Dry run** - Preview without making changes:

   ```bash
   copybara migrate copy.bara.sky --dry-run
   ```

2. **Folder destination** - Output to local folder for review:

   ```starlark
   core.workflow(
       destination = folder.destination(),
       # ...
   )
   ```

3. **Validate command** - Check config syntax:
   ```bash
   copybara validate copy.bara.sky
   ```

From [Understanding the workflow](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss/c/1IImRPHnpHc):

> The workaround was to use folder destination so they could iterate and re-apply copybara multiple times, then push manually.

### How do I preview changes before pushing?

**Use `folder.destination()` during development.**

From [Issue #43](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/43):

> A user was wondering how to dry run Copybara to preview results.

```starlark
# Development/testing workflow
core.workflow(
    name = "test",
    destination = folder.destination(),
    # ... same config as production
)
```

Then inspect the output folder before switching to `git.destination()`.

## Transformations

### How do I overlay/replace specific files?

From [Issue #43](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/43), there are two approaches:

**Option 1: Glob addition + core.move** (recommended for reversibility)

Include the overlay file via glob, then move it into place:

```starlark
core.workflow(
    # Include the overlay file explicitly
    origin_files = glob(["**"], exclude = ["internal/**"]) + glob(["internal/README.md"]),
    transformations = [
        core.move("internal/README.md", "README.md"),
    ],
)
```

**Option 2: core.copy with overwrite**

Copy a file over an existing one:

```starlark
transformations = [
    core.copy(
        before = "internal/README.md",
        after = "README.md",
        overwrite = True,
    ),
]
```

<Aside type="note">
  Using `overwrite = True` makes the transformation non-reversible, since
  there's no way to know the original file contents in the reverse workflow.
</Aside>

### Where can I find examples of custom transformations?

From [Issue #254](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/254):

> A user asked for examples of more complex transformations beyond simple copies and moves.

**Resources:**

- [Custom Transformations Guide](/transformations/custom/)
- [MongoDB's copy.bara.sky](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/copy.bara.sky) - Production example
- [CUE's copy.bara.sky](https://github.com/cuelang/cue/blob/master/_scripts/copy.bara.sky) - Gerrit integration

---

## Workflow Modes

### When should I use SQUASH vs ITERATIVE mode?

From [Issue #265](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/265):

**SQUASH mode:**

- Combines all commits into one
- Better for detecting empty/duplicate changes
- Recommended when you don't need individual commit history

**ITERATIVE mode:**

- Preserves individual commits
- Can cause issues with bidirectional sync (commits may duplicate)
- Best when combined with CHANGE_REQUEST for the reverse direction

A maintainer explained:

> "Copybara enforces a single source of truth for a set of files."

**Recommended pattern:**

```starlark
# Source of truth → mirror (ITERATIVE)
core.workflow(
    name = "push",
    mode = "ITERATIVE",
    # ...
)

# External PRs → source of truth (CHANGE_REQUEST)
core.workflow(
    name = "pull",
    mode = "CHANGE_REQUEST",
    # ...
)
```

### Does Copybara preserve merge commits?

**No.** Copybara produces linear history by design.

From [Issue #99](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/99), a maintainer confirmed:

> "Copybara moves commits as linear history."

Even with `first_parent = False`, merge commits are treated as regular commits. If you need to preserve merge structure, consider:

- Using `integrates` for external changes
- Using `git.github_pr_destination` for PR-based workflows
- Adding `metadata.expose_label("COPYBARA_INTEGRATE_REVIEW")`

---

## File Selection

### What's the difference between origin_files and destination_files?

From [Issue #56](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/56) and [Issue #75](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/75):

**origin_files** - Controls which files are **read from source**:

```starlark
# Only sync src/ and docs/, exclude secrets
origin_files = glob(["src/**", "docs/**"], exclude = ["**/*.secret"])
```

**destination_files** - Controls which files **can be modified in destination**:

```starlark
# Only touch files in vendor/lib/, leave everything else alone
destination_files = glob(["vendor/lib/**"])
```

<Aside type="caution">
  A common mistake: putting exclusions in `destination_files` instead of
  `origin_files`. As a collaborator clarified: "The one in destination_files
  basically is to check that you don't write those files or delete them."
</Aside>

### Why are excluded files still being copied?

From [Issue #56](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/56):

**Problem:** Files added to exclude array still appear in destination.

**Solution:** Make sure exclusions are in `origin_files`, not `destination_files`:

```starlark
# CORRECT - exclude in origin_files
origin_files = glob(["**"], exclude = ["secrets/**", "*.key"])

# WRONG - this only prevents writing/deleting, not reading
destination_files = glob(["**"], exclude = ["secrets/**"])
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Why does Copybara say "No changes to migrate"?

**The destination already has all changes from origin.**

Copybara reads `GitOrigin-RevId` from the last destination commit and only syncs newer changes.

**Solutions:**

1. Use `--ignore-noop` to not fail on no changes
2. Use `--force` to re-sync anyway
3. Use `--last-rev` to start from a specific commit

**See also:** [Common Issues](/troubleshooting/common-issues/)

### What does "No new changes to import for resolved ref" mean?

From [Issue #27](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/27):

This warning appears when you specify a `--last-rev` that's already the final commit in your source repository.

**Solution for importing full history:**

```bash
# First run - point to earliest commit to import
copybara migrate copy.bara.sky --last-rev <first-commit-sha>

# Subsequent runs - no flag needed, Copybara auto-detects
copybara migrate copy.bara.sky
```

A contributor noted there's no "zero" SHA-1 reference in Git for importing from the very beginning, so you must specify the first commit you want.

### Why is Copybara stuck on the initial run?

From [Copybara is stuck on the initial run](https://groups.google.com/g/copybara-discuss/c/la2jAUxXqPo):

Common causes:

1. **Large repository** - Initial clone takes time
2. **Network issues** - Slow connection to Git server
3. **Many commits** - Use `--last-rev` to limit history

```bash
# Start from recent history only
copybara migrate copy.bara.sky --last-rev HEAD~100
```

### How do I handle submodules?

From [Issue #84](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/84) and [Issue #216](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/216):

> Submodule not registered in destination / Cannot find object when running with submodules.

Copybara has limited submodule support. Consider:

1. Using `git.origin()` with `submodules = "NO"` (default)
2. Flattening submodules before sync
3. Syncing submodule content separately

## Feature Requests

### Does Copybara support GitLab/Bitbucket natively?

**Git operations work, but no native API integration** (unlike GitHub).

From [Issue #153](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/153):

> GitLab support is requested.

**Workaround:** Use `git.origin()` and `git.destination()` with HTTPS/SSH URLs.

**See also:** [Unsupported Platforms](/guides/unsupported-platforms/overview/)

### Can I force push to destination?

**Not recommended**, but possible with custom scripts.

From [Issue #136](https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/136):

> A user wanted to protect the branch in the destination repo.

Copybara is designed for incremental sync, not force pushes. If you need to rewrite history, consider resetting the destination branch manually first.
