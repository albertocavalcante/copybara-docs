## What is Copybara?

Copybara is Google's tool for **transforming and moving code between repositories**. It enables workflows like:

- **Open sourcing** internal code to public repositories
- **Importing contributions** from external repos back to internal
- **Mirroring** repositories with transformations
- **Syncing** subsets of monorepos to standalone repositories

## Quick Example

```starlark title="copy.bara.sky"
core.workflow(
    name = "export-to-github",
    origin = git.origin(
        url = "https://internal.git/repo",
        ref = "main",
    ),
    destination = git.github_pr_destination(
        url = "https://github.com/org/public-repo",
        destination_ref = "main",
    ),
    origin_files = glob(["src/**"], exclude = ["**/internal/**"]),
    transformations = [
        core.move("src/", ""),
        core.replace("internal.corp", "example.com"),
    ],
    mode = "SQUASH",
)
```
